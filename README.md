# Mystique

This repo contains code for converting adaptive cards GUI design image into Json 
faster-rcnn neural model is used for this purpose

#Environment Setup:

This repo implements tensorflow research models, hence it necessary to have that repo in your machine 
    
    https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git

extend PYTHONPATH with newly cloned repo
    
    cd models/models/reseach/
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/slim

#Steps to train the model
